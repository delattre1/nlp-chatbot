The plan was: "just make the chatbot work, but now consuming one external API".

There were not a lot of difficulties. 

Here is a link to the API docs integration that was used, it shows how to consume the API: https://docs.zenquotes.io/zenquotes-documentation/

My use case is: a user that is having a bad day, so it will get a nice and warm message from the bot, to make his day a little bit better
