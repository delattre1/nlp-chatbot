# Essay 5

For the 5th part of the project, I used GPT-3 to improve the content generation.

When the user sends the !generate command, the script will filter webpages related to the search_term, 
and get random sections of text from these sites. 

After that, this random text is sended to OpenAI API, with a context prompt that tells GPT-3 to generated content related to the section of text that it received.

This interaction is using the Completion model text-davinci-003 to generate content related to the websites content.
